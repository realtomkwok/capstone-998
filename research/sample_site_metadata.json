Here are some expert tips on getting active at home\n=============================================================================================\n\n*   [By Kate O'Halloran](https://www.abc.net.au/news/kate-ohalloran/10821058)\n    \n*   [Topic:Sport](https://www.abc.net.au/news/topic/sport)\n    \n\n8h ago8 hours agoSat 12 Oct 2024 at 4:01pm\n\n![A woman does a side plank in gym gear next to a white wall.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9181888882371eb4c1925be2485ebb37?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2260&cropW=3390&xPos=118&yPos=55&width=862&height=575)\n\nDisplay caption\n\nExperts like Ange Drake say we can put together an impactful exercise program with minimal equipment. (Supplied)\n\nWatching the Olympics and Paralympics has inspired a number of Australians to get more active. But with the cost of living rising, not everyone can afford a gym membership.\n\nThe good news is that there's a variety of free and low-cost ways to increase your activity levels, including setting up a 'do it yourself' (DIY) home gym and program.\n\nWe asked the experts for some tips on what equipment you need, and how to get started.\n\nWhat equipment do I need to do strength-based training at home?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnge Drake runs 23W, a women's-only strength and conditioning gym in the inner north of Melbourne.\n\nShe says it's possible to put together a \"really great training program with very minimal equipment\".\n\nIn terms of a bare minimum set-up, Drake suggests starting with the following, which can be feasibly bought for approximately $50.\n\n*   An exercise mat\n*   A set of resistance bands\n*   A sturdy step\n*   Basic hand weights, e.g. 2kg, 6kg and 10kg dumbbells OR (if these are unaffordable) start with household items like canned goods\n*   A foam roller\n*   A sturdy chair OR (if you can afford it) an adjustable exercise bench\n*   A skipping rope\n\nThese items are all versatile enough to be used for a variety of purposes, while Drake says what is most important is being consistent.\n\n![Hand weights, a yoga mat, skipping rope and a water bottle sit on the floor.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/119021dc13e17d1ec720116d64fb460d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3333&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)\n\nWhen building a home gym start with the basics, like hand weights and a mat. (Pexels)\n\n\"Where a lot of people fall over is that they make the investment into a really great home gym, use it a couple of times and then the motivation wears off,\" she says.\n\nHer advice is to start by building as much structure as possible into your routine.\n\n\"I advise booking exercise in, so actually physically put it in your diary, whether that's an online calendar, or one on the fridge for your whole family to see,\" Drake says.\n\n\"That's important because you're making a commitment to yourself that this is the time you're going to practice the self-care that is physical activity.\"\n\n![Two women look at a phone while in gym gear.

(Supplied)\n\nHow to write an exercise program\n--------------------------------\n\nOnce you've got some basic equipment, you're going to need an exercise program to follow.\n\nFor those who can afford it, Drake advises enlisting a personal trainer or exercise physiologist to help.\n\n\"They will be able to give you a well-balanced and structured program, with things you need to do as well as want to do, and make sure you are moving well,\" she says.\n\n\"Having a coach will also help keep you accountable.\"\n\n![Full length of young woman doing warm up exercise.

(Getty Images: Morsa Images)\n\nSome gyms offer 'hybrid' memberships where you can access face-to-face coaching in the first instance, before following an assigned program via an app at home.\n\nYouTube can also be a good resource, but Drake cautions that you cross-reference someone's qualifications before taking their advice.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are people in this space who promote fitness and nutritional advice that is not backed by science, and who make money off the vulnerabilities of others,\" she says.\n\nIt is also possible to write your own program by keeping some basic principles in mind.\n\nHugh Mason, an exercise physiologist and strength and conditioning coach with North Melbourne's AFLW team, advises targeting multiple muscle groups in a single session.\n\n![A man and a woman stand on a grassed oval and talk to each other.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bc95d121265fc27eb753310dec248be4?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=658&cropW=987&xPos=68&yPos=61&width=862&height=575)\n\nHugh Mason is a strength and conditioning coach with North Melbourne's AFLW team. (Supplied)\n\nFor example, a 30-minute program could incorporate exercises that build upper body, lower body and core strength.\n\nSome examples include basic 'body weight' exercises like squats, push-ups and planks.\n\nMason advises doing both single and double limb exercises, as well as challenging your muscles to work in different directions.\n\n\"You can break exercises down in lots of ways,\" he explains.\n\n\"So if you do something like a bench press, that's an upper body 'pushing' exercise, whereas if you do a 'row' that's a 'pulling' exercise.\"\n\n![Three men crouch down on a gym floor and look at an iPad.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bc4c1afb9e02a5717d805f74c28073c5?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1232&cropW=1848&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)\n\nExercises can be broken down into categories like push, pull and functional fitness. (Image Road Photography)\n\nSingle leg exercises, meanwhile, build 'functional' fitness.\n\n\"If you think about it, most things in life are done on one leg, like walking up stairs, running and jumping. So you could add in things like a lunge, or a split squat.\"\n\nFor extra practical benefit, Mason also recommends a 'carry' exercise, which means walking while carrying a weight.\n\n\"That could mean carrying a weight in one hand, or even a shopping bag full of stuff above your head,\" he says.\n\nCardiovascular or 'aerobic' exercise\n------------------------------------\n\nA good home-based program should also supplement strength training with cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise.\n\nThese include popular options like walking, running, cycling and swimming.\n\n![A man runs on a beach in running gear.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/24cd27113fdda522a00da033af202f40?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1825&cropW=2738&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)\n\nA good home-based program should supplement strength training with some cardio, like walking, running or cycling.   (Supplied)\n\nNo matter which you choose, pacing is key.\n\n\"I think because of social media, some people think it's normal to just go and try to run 10km, or a marathon,\" Mason says.\n\n\"That's great, because people are getting into running. But if you haven't done the appropriate training, it's probably not going to go well.\"\n\nUp to a third of people who run, Mason says, drop out because of some type of injury. But this can be prevented with structured progression.\n\nIf you'd like to start running, he advises starting off with 30 seconds of walking, followed by 30 seconds of jogging.\n\n\"You can do a kilometre of that \\[30 seconds walking, 30 seconds jogging\\] for a week. Then you might add 200-300 meters per week, and build it out from there.\"\n\n![A woman running wearing a grey hoodie and grey pants.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3eccac73c6687e70994f7b49d728f4c6?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=3333&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)\n\nIf you want to run, Mason advises building up slowly from walking. (Pexels: Cottonbro)\n\nYou can also progress by doubling the amount you run, as opposed to walking.\n\n\"So instead of walking 100m and jogging for 50m, double the amount you run, and build up that way.\n\n\"It's a gradual progression, where you'll walk less and run more.\"\n\nIt's important, however, not to go too fast, too quickly.\n\n\"People get really keen, because they're enjoying it,\" he says.\n\n\"The endorphins are pumping and they start to feel good.\n\n\"But when you're starting off, you probably want to have a day \\[of rest\\] in between whatever you're doing.\"\n\nDrake agrees, adding that 'more' is not necessarily better when it comes to cardio.\n\nIf you're time poor, she recommends a 10 or 20 minute HIIT session (high intensity interval training).\n\n![Two women in activewear touch hands while holding a plank position on yoga mats on a rooftop.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/36fc4f1af873e9badaa8cc26808adac8?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1997&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=575)\n\nHigh intensity interval training can help if you're time poor. (Unsplash: Louis Quintero)\n\nThis could be done with something as simple as a skipping rope, starting with 20 seconds of skipping followed by 40 seconds of rest.\n\n\"If what you're looking for is weight loss, we know that intensity over duration is key,\" she says.\n\n\"So the idea is to work harder for short bursts of time, and then rest.\n\n\"I always say that a good work-out is one that happens, so you're better off doing two or three 20-minute workouts a week than one 60-minute one that may or may not happen.\"\n\nWhen to progress your program, and why recovery is key\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou will know that it's time to 'progress' your exercise routine when something feels too easy.\n\nAs Mason puts it, you will eventually 'outgrow' an exercise because \"the stimulus is the same as what it has been for a while.\"\n\n![A man in a red shirt stands at the back of a gymnasium and watches on as another man jumps. The jumping man is blurred.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0a05bee989821c6d0ae4cdae34c344c3?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=547&cropW=821&xPos=0&yPos=429&width=862&height=575)\n\nWhen something feels too easy, that's when it's time to progress. ( Image Road Photography)\n\nThat's when you can adapt exercises to make them harder, for example by adding extra weight, repetitions or sets, or challenging yourself to run faster or for longer.\n\n\"But the important thing is not to change too many things at once,\" he says.\n\n\"So maybe don't increase your running distance and pace at the same time, or your sets and reps at the same time.\n\n\"Once you tolerate one of those changes, that's when you can make the other.\"\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that as you progress your exercise program, your need for 'refuelling' and recovery also increases.\n\nCommon recovery activities include yoga, massage, meditation, ice baths and saunas.\n\nBut if the idea of an ice bath makes you squirm, Mason has some reassurance.\n\n\"My advice is to do what makes you feel good, because recovery is as much psychological as it is physiological.\n\n\"If you don't like ice baths, don't do it, because it could make you stressed and have the opposite effect of what you're looking for.\n\n\"If you want to go for a walk on the beach with your dog, or sit in the grass and read a book, that's great. If that makes you feel good, that's your recovery.\"\n\nGet a morning news briefing in your inbox\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe to our ABC NewsMail bringing you breaking news from overnight, plus a heads-up on the stories that will shape your day.\n\nYour information is being handled in accordance with the [ABC Privacy Collection Statement](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001511015)\n.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)\n and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)\n apply.\n\nEmail address\n\nSubscribe",
